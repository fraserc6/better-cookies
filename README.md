## What is it? 

This is a boilerplate project with Next.js v10 and Tailwind v2. 

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

## Expanding 

The Tailwind config is currently only purging the /pages/ directory. If you want to create a new root level folder for components or other template files, be sure to add this to the purge array in tailwind.config.js
